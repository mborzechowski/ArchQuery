# Architects Query


This is my first bigger project :) 
The purpose of this application is to provide freelance architects with a tool that allows them to send preliminary questions and surveys to potential clients. The questions and the survey are fully editable, allowing for the addition of new questions/items to the survey. Responses are stored in the database, providing the administrator with easy access to them.
